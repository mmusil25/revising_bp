Work Idea:

Build a network from scratch which does basic classification (MNIST). And then slowly add more features and complexity. 

Read the source code for PyTorch. How do they perform auto-gradient descent? 

Maybe we can inherit classes from PyTorch and modify them? 


Group questions:

Should we be using an auto-gradient  


Work Goals: 

Jian will build a simple 2 layer-network

Rest of group will read up on PyTorch
