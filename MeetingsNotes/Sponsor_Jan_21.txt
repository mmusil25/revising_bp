Meeting Jan 21 2019

Attendees:

Manny's Presentation:

We should base our approach on only the output difference e_j(x) = d_j(x) - y_j(x)

Assume that each node introduces an equal amount of error and use the feed forward amplification to create a novel delta function (equation 4.13 on Manny's hand-out). Start with equation 4.1 and the sheet. 
 
No convolution

Project Design Specifications: 

Deliverables: Repo (leave private for now), Choose a few examples (MNIST), full-wiki for code usage in the future, Shoot for 93% accuracy or greater on MNIST. Metrics: Accuracy, passes needed for training, execution time. 


Work Schedule: 

Jan 21 - Friday Feb 22 (Next meeting at Willow Creek): 

DUE: Set of equations for more mathematical formalities. Create a network from scratch that can measure accuracy, how many epochs pass, execution time. Choose a system for benchmarking that is common.
