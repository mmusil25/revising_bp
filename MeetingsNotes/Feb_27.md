### General

Maybe Manny thinks we should be eliminating noise early in the network so that it is not multiplied. 

###  Updates

**Jian** - Working on analyzing input noise using adverserial networks. 

**Yuhao** - Working on visualisation tools for understanding the gradient better. 

**Mark** - Still working on the error saturation prevention method implementation. Shoud take the next two-three weeks.
