### General

We had the second check-in with Andrew today and he brought to our attention the following items that should be addressed. 

* Our personal weekly reports to Dr. Schubert should also include one team update.
* We need to add some stuff to project proposal 
* We need to budget time for a 10+ page final reports
* Github issues will allow us to evenly divide work
* The industry sponsor needs to approve the project proposal


###  Updates

**Jian** - Continued (finished I think) working on  his from-scratch network. Still reading papers. 

**Mark** - Read a few papers, found a few promising ideas. 



### Next steps


**All**   - Revise the project proposal to include the items Andrew addressed
**Jian**  - Add group updates to weekly reports
