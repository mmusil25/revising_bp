### General

Presented current work to Sponsor. 

Manny prefers to use absolute error (predict-truth) because it does not lose direction information. Also one hot encoding. Should end with MNIST. Wants some sort of gradient free approach. 


Manny really wants us to reduce the noise in the system. We should consider 



###  Updates

**Jian** - Noise is characteristic of the system. Error is prediction versus target. We need to clarify which Manny wants to improve. 

**Yuhao** - Reading 'Training Neural Networks Without Gradients a scalable ADMM approach'. Noise cancelling is something we should look into . 

**Mark** - Still working on the error saturation prevention method implementation. Shoud take the next two-three weeks.
