### General

Presented current work to Sponsor. 

Manny prefers to use absolute error (predict-truth) because it does not lose direction information. Also one hot encoding. Should end with MNIST. Wants some sort of gradient free approach. 



###  Updates

**Jian** - Working on analyzing input noise using adverserial networks. 

**Yuhao** - Working on visualisation tools for understanding the gradient better. 

**Mark** - Still working on the error saturation prevention method implementation. Shoud take the next two-three weeks.
