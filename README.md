# Backpropagation_Capstone
An exploration into new adaptive learning rate optimizers for neural networks to reduce propagated error which is amplified through successive network layers. 


## Project Guide

The best document with which to start is the final report in this directory. The project documents from the beginning of the capstone are under "ProjectStartDocs". 

To access the program which executes the neural network tests, navigate to the folder "NNNP_TEST" and check the readme file. This will explain how to use the program.
