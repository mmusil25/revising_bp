# Backpropagation_Capstone
An exploration into new adaptive learning rate optimizers for neural networks to reduce propagated error. 


## Project Guide

The essential project documents are all in this directory and the best document with which to start is the final report. 

To access the program which executes the neural network tests, navigate to the folder "NNNP_TEST" and check the readme file. This will explain how to use the program.
